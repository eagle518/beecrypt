1.0.2:

1.0.1:
	* The Windows 2000 bug is still around

1.0.0:
	* On Windows 2000, the entropy system gets error WAVERR_BADFORMAT in waveInOpen; So far I've been unable to determine why the system does this for format WAVE_FORMAT_PCM. Suggestions to fix this problem are more than welcome.
	* The assembler code for SHA-1 in gnu/fips180opt.gas.i586.s contains bugs.
